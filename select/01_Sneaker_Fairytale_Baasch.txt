Once upon a night, seven clocks away
Before the world became what it is today

Did it happen, did it happen wasn't true at all
You made me kind of happy, then I had to go

I lost my sneaker at midnight
I lost my sneaker at midnight
I know you wore my fairytale
Last night you wore my fairytale

Last night I sneak to the playground
Last night I sneak to the playground
I know you wore my fairytale
Last night you wore my fairytale

I got wasted, I got wasted someone put a charm
Meet my friend, spend my money, last my credit card

The night was a chapter of our tale
And an I hapily lived for you ever after

I lost my sneaker at midnight
I lost my sneaker at midnight
I know you wore my fairytale
Last night you wore my fairytale

Last night I sneak to the playground
Last night I sneak to the playground
I know you wore my fairytale
Last night you wore my fairytale
